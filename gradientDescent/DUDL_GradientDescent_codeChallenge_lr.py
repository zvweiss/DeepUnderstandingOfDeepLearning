# ### G.D. using a gradient-based learning rate

# %%
# random starting point
localmin = np.random.choice(x, 1)

# learning parameters
learning_rate = 0.01

# ### G.D. using a time-based learning rate

# %%
# redefine parameters

localmin = initval

# run through training and store all the results
modelparamsTime = np.zeros((training_epochs, 3))
for i in range(training_epochs):
    grad = deriv(localmin)
    lr = learning_rate * (1 - (i + 1) / training_epochs)
    localmin = localmin - lr * grad
    modelparamsTime[i, 0] = localmin[0]

    modelparamsTime[i, 2] = lr


# ### Plot the results

# %%

# generate the plots

    ax[i].plot(modelparamsFixed[:, i], "o-", markerfacecolor="w")
    ax[i].plot(modelparamsGrad[:, i], "o-", markerfacecolor="w")
    ax[i].plot(modelparamsTime[:, i], "o-", markerfacecolor="w")
    ax[i].set_xlabel("Iteration")

ax[0].set_ylabel("Local minimum")
ax[1].set_ylabel("Derivative")

# # Additional explorations

# %%
# 1) Change the initial learning rate in the "time" experiment from .1 to .01. Do you still reach the same conclusion that
#    dynamic learning rates are better than a fixed learning rate?
#
# 2) Compute the average of all time-based learning rates (see variable 'modelparamsTime'). Next, replace the fixed
#    learning rate with the average over all dynamic learning rates. How does that affect the model's performance?
#
# 3) Going back to the original code (without the modifications above), you saw that the fixed learning rate model didn't
#    get to the correct local minimum. What happens if you increase the number of training epochs from 50 to 500? Does that
#    improve the situation, and what does that tell you about the relationship between learning rate and training epochs?
#
# 4) The code here initializes the starting value as a random number, which will differ for each learning rate method.
#    Is that appropriate or inappropriate for this experiment? Why? Change the code so that the starting value is the
#    same for all three learning rate models.
